# ðŸšŒ EasyBus â€“ Terminal-Based Bus Management System in C

**EasyBus** is a terminal-based bus reservation system built using **C** and classic **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Designed to simulate real-world bus operations, the system allows users to book and cancel tickets, track seat availability, and calculate the shortest route between stops using graph-based algorithms.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Schedule Management:** Add/view bus details including route, timings, and seats.
- **Ticket Booking & Cancellation:** Real-time seat tracking with persistent storage using file handling.
- **Graph-based Shortest Route:** Efficiently calculates shortest paths between stops using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Role-Based Access:** Secure login for Admin and Passengers.
- **Persistent Storage:** Uses file handling to store booking data and maintain user state.
